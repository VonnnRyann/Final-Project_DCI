The app is our solution to what we consider a \\\"good\\\" problem: People want to understand,connect,express emotions or feelings and to learn more, and since not everyone has access to classes, by adding W2M to their language list,we wanted to take this into our hands and teach you Wave2Me sign language as if we're there with you in person.

We know for all of its complexities like any other language , one app is never enough to master a language, however this is an opportunity for you to start the shift from vocal to a visual language.
