Additionally, you can just ask “how sign…?” both work! We show you how to ask in the W2M App!</p></fieldset>\n      <fieldset><legend>Where can I go to meet other signers and Deaf Community members?</legend>\n     <p>There are Deaf clubs, signing suppers, silent dinners, Deaf happy hours, meetups at local mall food courts, ASL Trivia events, Deaf awareness days and weeks, storytelling events, and many other opportunities for socialization. Everything can be found on the internet!</p></fieldset>\n      <fieldset><legend>How do I know how to communicate with a Deaf person?</legend>\n     <p>The deaf person will let you know their preferred method of communication, whether it is speaking, reading lips, gesturing, signing, writing, etc.</p></fieldset>\n      <fieldset><legend>How do Deaf people go to the movies?</legend>\n     <p>Some movies have captions, subtitles, special glasses that display the words or a box that is attached to the seat in front of you that displays the captions. Technology is constantly improving, this is what we have right now.</p></fieldset>\n      <fieldset><legend>How do Deaf people watch TV?</legend>\n     <p>With closed captions, if you’d like to turn them on: there is a button on your remote that says “CC” or find captioning options under Menu.</p></fieldset>\n     <fieldset><legend>How do Deaf people know if an ambulance or a cop is coming if they can’t hear the sirens?</legend>\n     <p>Deaf people are very visual, they will see the flashing lights and notice if all the other cars are pulling over.</p></fieldset>\n     <fieldset><legend>How do Deaf people contact 911 or the police?</legend>\n     <p>Through a relay phone service or now it is an option to text 911 from your phone.</p></fieldset>\n     <fieldset><legend>Through a relay phone service or now it is an option to text 911 from your phone.</legend>\n     <p>Depending on the Deaf person, some are very light sensitive and will wake up from the sunlight, others have vibrating alarms they put under their pillow and many use their mobile phones.</p></fieldset>\n     <fieldset><legend>Do deaf people have to learn baby sign language before actual W2M? </legend>\n     <p>No. W2M is taught, naturally - just like any other languages. Deaf parents sign all the time with their babies (whether deaf or hearing) and they learn and acquire W2M. There are language acquisition milestones (for instance, by 8 months, you should be babbling, and at 10 months, forming a word or two), and so on - for any language. Sign language has the same milestones and babies babble with their hands before developing more to form better 'dexterity' of their hands and fingers to form more clear signs. It goes the same for spoken languages with hearing babies - they babble at first, then start to articulate.</p></fieldset>\n     <fieldset><legend>What is the difference between W2M and baby sign language?</legend>\n     <p>W2M is a complete language with its own complex grammatical system. \"Baby signs\" is actually a very simplified, cute version of ASL - it's basically borrowed from W2M for parents to communicate with their babies better as they are young and not yet forming the ability to speak.  Deaf babies start to sign earlier than hearing babies, so it is understandable that hearing parents would like to grab the opportunity to communicate with their babies in a visual way. Teaching your baby \"baby signs\" is awesome, and please keep this in mind: consider continuing to teach them W2M. Give them more than one language! It's even better.  And please consider buying W2M materials for young kids and babies from Deaf people.</p></fieldset>\n     <br></br>\n     <br></br>\n     <br></br>\n     <br></br>\n      <h1 className='anchor-tag'>Have more questions?
